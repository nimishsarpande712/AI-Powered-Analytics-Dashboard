## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm
- A running MySQL server

### 1. Backend Setup

First, set up the server which will connect to your database and serve the API.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nimishsarpande712/AI-Powered-Analytics-Dashboard.git
cd AI-Powered-Analytics-Dashboard/Backend

# 2. Install backend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file in the Backend root and add your database credentials:
DB_HOST=your_host
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=analytics_db

# 4. Seed the database
# This script will populate your 'analytics_db' with data from the marketing_campaign.csv file.
npm run seed

# 5. Start the backend server
# The server will run on http://localhost:5000
npm start
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Next, set up the React client which will consume the API.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ../Frontend/analytics-dashboard

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file in the frontend/analytics-dashboard directory and add the API URL:
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# 4. Start the frontend development server
# The React app will open and run on http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

Once both servers are running, open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.
